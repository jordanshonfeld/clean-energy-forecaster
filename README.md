# Clean Energy Forecaster
This simple web application helps people visualize when to utilize clean energy depending on time of the day!

**To deploy this application yourself, clone the reponsitory in the API folder, run:**

pip install flask <br>
flask run

**then, in the energy-planner folder run:**

npm start

## Some features I'm excited to add:Â 
<ul>
<li>Be able to select your BA</li>
<li>Be able to look at actual (non-forecasted) data for prior days (or avgs over weeks/months)</li>
<li>choose color scheme</li>
<li>make UI more elegant</li>
<li>build out a ~show me more~ button that essentially just shows users whats going on underneath the hood (how much energy is expected to be produced at this hour, how much of that is green, how are we deciding what a green hour is vs a red hour)</li>
<li>Ensure that data from earlier in the day is correct (not forecasted) - could look into using Wattime for this</li>
</ul>
